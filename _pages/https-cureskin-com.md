I have been consulting to different dermatologists but didn't get satisfaction. As I heard about this app, I too had a doubt, that how could an app help with my skin but after using it, all my doubts were cleared. It is user friendly, you can clear all your doubts through chats. I had regular follow ups and used the regimen exactly as per the instructions. I would recommend to use CureSkin app and get clearer skin.

What I have done, is only that I trusted this app, so I suggest to everyone that just have patience and listen to ur dermatologist carefully and follow the regimen. My dermatologist Dr.Charu was very kind and really helpful. Thank you cure skin app, I'm so happy that I choosen this app.

I got surprisingly nice results after using the regimen, which I didn't expect. I was thinking that it will give me something temporary but I was wrong about it. After using the products, my skin doesn't need makeup and I can freely go outside without getting ready. It gave me a confidence to stand anywhere without getting uncomfortable. I am really thankful to cureskin.
