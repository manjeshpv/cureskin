Yet they spend so much on expensive products with nothing really working. Even when they go to a clinic, the doctor doesnâ€™t even know if you are got better with the treatment they gave. <br/> <br/> And we are changing all that. </p> <div class="text-center" style="margin:30px 0;"> <img src="https://cureskin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/working-2.jpg" alt="Our Story"> </div> <section style="margin: 30px 0;"> <small>Behind the scenes</small> <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 24px">The CureSkin Team</h2> <p>Get to know the people behind CureSkin!</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-4"> <img src="https://cureskin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GUNA.jpg-1.jpg" alt="Guna Kakulapati"> <h6>Guna Kakulapati <small>Co-founder & CEO</small></h6> </div> <div class="col-sm-4"> <img src="https://cureskin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Rama.jpg-1.jpg" alt="Ramakrishna R"> <h6>Ramakrishna R <small>Co-Founder &amp; CTO</small></h6> </div> <div class="col-sm-4"> <img src="https://cureskin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DR.charu_.jpg-1.jpg" alt="Dr. Charu Sharma"> <h6>Dr. Charu Sharma <small>Head of Dermatology</small></h6> </div> </div> </section> </div>
