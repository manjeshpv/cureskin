&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dry skin is usually harmless hence most people just use over the counter products or try brands they see in prominent advertisements to get rid of it. Trying out home remedies that claim to be simple and cost-effective is another trend when it comes to treating dry skin.</span>
