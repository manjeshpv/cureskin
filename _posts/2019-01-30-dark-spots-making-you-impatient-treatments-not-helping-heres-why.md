Tried everything you could get your hands on but still no results? Have been taking self-treatment for about 2 weeks now and still see dark spots? Their presence makes you angry and under confident? Here’s what’s happening.

Your skin care regimen might be the culprit. If you try to scrub it off with an exfoliator it just gets worse. Similarly, if you are using just a normal skin lightening cream instead of a medicated one, it also ends up causing trouble.

Level up your sunscreen game. Regular use of sunscreen is very important. As it protects the skin from the harmful UV rays of the sun and prevents you from getting dark spots.

You need to make sure you’re using a good quality sunscreen which is apt for your skin type and condition of your skin.

Give it some time. Sometimes dark spots take around 6 months to one year to fade away.
If you do not provide it with the right treatment then it can be a permanent mark.

Don’t mix up products. In between whatever treatment you’re taking, you must have experimented with a couple of other products and even home remedies. That is a bad idea altogether. If you are following one regimen or product then follow only that until the course is over. If you mix products then there are chances that it reacts with one another and give you bad results or worsen the condition even more.

It’s not about the most expensive treatment; it’s about the right one at the right time. Try the Cure Skin regimen at half the price of what you’d give for higher-end treatments. And start seeing the change.
