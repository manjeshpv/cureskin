<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cureskin.com/category/burn-marks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burn marks</a> are frustrating, isn’t it? Unfortunately, surviving every day without it leaving behind marks on you is almost impossible! Sadly, marks due to burns are quite common to happen and affect one’s appearance &amp; confidence badly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to remove burn marks, you need to understand what caused it and how deep it is.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What causes Burn Marks? </span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we touch something hot, like a pressure cooker while busy cooking, or accidentally splash boiling water on the skin while bathing, it causes burns. Skin burns can also be caused due to harmful chemicals, the hot sun, and electricity. Such burnt parts of the skin repair itself leaving behind a residual mark that shows on the skin. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some burn marks/scars are temporary and some fade over time. Others are permanent. It depends on the depth of the damage done. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of Burns</span></h2>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>First-degree burns:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Heals on their own within a week without causing scars.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Second-degree burns: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heals in about two weeks leaving a scar behind, but it may fade with time.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Third-degree burns:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This type of burn will not heal without medical intervention. Take months or years to heal. They leave behind scars.
</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing <strong>New Burns Marks:</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have just burnt your skin, it’s easy to prevent marks from happening! Here’s what you can do immediately to improve your chances for less or no scarring.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cool the burn.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apply cold, wet compresses on the burn for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply </span><b>petroleum jelly </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 to 3 times daily. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Do not apply ointments,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toothpaste or butter to the burn, as these may cause an infection. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not apply </span><b>topical antibiotics.</b></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cover the burn with a</span><b> nonstick, sterile bandage.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span><b>blisters </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Do not pop </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the blisters.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider taking over-the-counter pain medication such as </span><b>acetaminophen or ibuprofen.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This can help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Protect the area from the sun: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing protective clothing or applying a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Sun exposure turns your wound into a much darker color because of excessive melanin pigment generation. Fixing scars becomes difficult this way.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing </span><b>Old Burns Marks:</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the scar is too old, not much can be done without medical intervention. However, you can make the scar less visible by </span><b>moisturizing it and protecting it from the sun.</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: There’s no known way to make scars from severe burns totally disappear, but you can try making it lighter with skin doctor’s help.</span></i>
