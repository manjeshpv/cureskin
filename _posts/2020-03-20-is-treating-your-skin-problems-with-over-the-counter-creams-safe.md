<span style="font-weight: 400;">When our skin looks good, we look good. Clean and trouble-free skin is something all of us crave for. To look perfect goes a lot of time pampering our skin through day and night with moisturizing creams, oils, cleansers and what not! But not all day is Sunday. We have bad-skin days, sometimes acne pops up, sometimes infection sets in, and sometimes we just get tanned on a hot summer day, isn’t it? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many such skin problems just vanish with time, but some continue to bother us. Coincidently, facing skin problems reminds us of all the skin cream advertisements with its magical effects. Many of us unknowingly buy such over-the-counter face creams, ointments to treat various skin problems like acne, pigmentation, fungal infection, rash, etc directly from the chemists who are allowed to sell the drug freely without a dermatologist's prescription. There comes the real problem!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these </span><b>commercially available creams have a high amount of “steroid” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">due to its bleaching, depigmentation and anti-inflammatory effects.  This drug used in skin creams has the ability to cure a wide variety of disorders ONLY if used right. Unfortunately, it is causing more damage to the skin than it repairs as </span><b>most of us are not using them under medical supervision.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out if your skin cream, gel, face wash, soap or any skin product have steroids: <a href="https://checkmycream.com/">CHECK MY CREAM</a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before prescribing such medications to you, skin doctors/dermatologists consider:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><b>age</b></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>duration </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">of your problem</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>depth </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">of your problem</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>sensitivity </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">of your skin affected and much more.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon this, they also carefully decide the “</span><b>duration of usage</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and “</span><b>amount of usage</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to ensure safety. No wonder why they are experts.  </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not following any of these will result in adverse effects and cause skin damage that is more permanent and irreversible. </span>

<b><i>Here’s how bad “steroid” can be in treating your skin problems if not supervised by a doctor:</i></b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too much usage of Steroids causes </span><b>skin thinning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  This can make you look old as your skin can collect wrinkles at a younger age.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using them in wrong areas of skin brings in </span><b>stretch marks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are permanent and irreversible.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excessive use of steroids causes </span><b>hypersensitivity </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the skin which leads to greater problems.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes your </span><b>unwanted hair longer and thicker</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Skin looks hairy.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usage of it near eyes affects your </span><b>eyesight </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the surrounding tissue absorbs it.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It even reduces the </span><b>skin’s ability to fight off bacterial and fungal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> infections. Your skin is left with weaker immunity.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, when you stop using such creams, it results in </span><b>intense skin redness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the formation of </span><b>fluid-filled bumps</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> damaging the skin.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, overusing such steroid-based over-the-counter creams without prescription damages your skin beyond your imagination. </span>
