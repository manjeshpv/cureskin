<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“Only fever and emergency situations need a doctor”</em> this is what you all must have thought. It’s a general trend among us to take self-treatments for small skin issues. But <em><strong>Dark Spots</strong></em> isn’t a one that can be healed with <em><strong>OTC medicines</strong></em> and <em><strong>home remedies</strong></em>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.</span><em><b> With no proper prescription:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You must have tried around 5 versions of the same over-the-counter products. Most dark spots require prescription medication, and only then it can make real progress once you start an appropriate, individualized treatment plan. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.  </span><em><b>Too much or Too little:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dark spots requires only a thin layer of medication. Applying more will dry out your skin and will not cure dark spots.  Even applying too little cannot solve your problem. This is where you need an expert’s directions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. </span><em><b>Using mixed products on the spot and mixing products within regimen:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you must be following a treatment your local doctor said but along with that, you must be using your daily skin products. Both these products have strong chemicals that can go react badly and leave your face with more dark spots.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.</span><em><b> Not bothered about the “After”:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You must have solved the issue partly and then once you start seeing your clear face you go back to your daily routine and slowly neglect the aftercare like applying sunscreen or finishing the medications course. Thus the issue bounces back in no time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. </span><em><b>Too late and Too wrong:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you must have waited a long time to finally address your issue and act upon it. Along with it, you get all the wrong medications. Now your condition has worsened beyond self-care. And thus the dark spots stay.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
