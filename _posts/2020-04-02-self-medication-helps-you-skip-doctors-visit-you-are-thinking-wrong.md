<span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many </span><b>painkillers and antibiotics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> easily available at the </span><b>local pharmacy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it becomes possible for anyone to self-medicate &amp; treat common health problems, isn’t it? Most of us have done it at some point in life! We tend to become self-doctors at times. In addition, the </span><b>internet makes it super easy to self-diagnose</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which is often wrong!) and self-medicate without ever seeing a doctor. Well, this appears to be convenient,  saves a hospital’s visit and a costly bill. But, little did you know that it comes at the expense of your health and </span><b>can cost your life too?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times we rely on pharmacists to find medical solutions, we treat the man in the medical store as a doctor. Of course a cheaper version of the doctor. The medicines/drugs they offer you might </span><b>look relatively safe, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">but it’s not! Inappropriate use of such over-the-counter (OTC) drugs could have</span><b> serious implications on your health</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pharmacists are </span><b>not trained health care professionals, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are here to make a profit out of selling medicines, do not blindly go by their words!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not just now, </span><b>but for generations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, people have been self-medicating to quick-fix health problems and to cope with life, often turning to drugs available over-the-counter. Whether it is just a </span><b>crocin (for fever!) or aspirin(for a headache!),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we believe they are ‘safe’ medicines and can be used by anyone. Not just these, people also prescribe doses of powerful drugs too by themselves due to </span><b>ignorance, misbelieves, advertisements, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">never bothering to consult the doctor. Popping pills to mask your health conditions may </span><b>get you instant relief </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">but what we don’t realize is that it is not free of side-effects. </span><b>It will make matters worse!</b>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">12 Reasons why self-medicating using over-the-counter drugs is dangerous.</span></h2>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, you might end up doing </span><b>wrong self-diagnosis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> followed by wrong self-medication.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrong medication can lead to </span><b>adverse reactions </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and worsen your health conditions.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some drugs lead to </span><b>addiction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it could also cost you your life.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some painkillers and antibiotics can’t be taken in</span><b> random doses,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but often, we underestimate its strength and take them in excess. Now, this is a real threat.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We simply do not know what the </span><b>drug/medicine is made up of,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it may or may not suit our body type.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not know whether it </span><b>can be combined with other medicines or not.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Truth is, we are ignorant, and ignorance is not bliss.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some drugs might be disastrous for someone </span><b>prone to allergies,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it creates </span><b>drug-dependence too</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are also clueless about the </span><b>side-effects of medicines on our body</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This leads to health complications.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some drugs may have </span><b>long-term consequences of liver or kidney failure.</b></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, there are high chances of </span><b>wrong administration of medicines</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and dosage.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the overuse of some drugs, our body starts </span><b>developing resistance to antibodies. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later</span><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">even when the right medicine is given, it may turn useless.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are totally unaware of </span><b>how the drug should be taken, its side-effects and even reactions. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, consulting a doctor is a must!</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-medication looks instant, and of course, there is no expense of the doctor. But eventually, you will suffer from severe health issues, your medical expense increases two-fold. </span><b>Your desire to self-medicate in order to avoid hospital may, ultimately, send you to the hospital.</b>
