<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are in a country where most people believe </span><b>light skin is beautiful</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>dark is ugly</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You’ll be shocked to know how the cosmetic business misuses this idea of beauty. Undeniably, this false belief of “</span><b>fairness is beautiful</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” has led us to make blind skincare choices for years and fall prey to these profit-hungry beauty industries. We choose to buy fairness creams at the </span><b>glance of an advertisement not knowing what’s inside it.</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, did you know - </span><b>Most of the fairness or cosmetic creams available in stores contain a harmful drug?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Yes, “</span><b>Steroid”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is used in the making of fairness creams </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">due to its </span><b>bleaching and depigmentation effects</b><b>.</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Overusing this drug or using it without prescription damages your skin beyond your imagination. Unfortunately, the</span><b> free availability of this steroid</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has allowed many of these fairness cream brands to become household names, wherein they are no longer considered drugs at all.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out if your skin cream, gel, face wash, soap or any skin product have steroids: <a target="_blank" href="https://checkmycream.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHECK MY CREAM</a>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> This fai</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rness drug which is banned in many countries is legally allowed in India due to loopholes in our law.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><b><i>Many Indians are unaware that they are absorbing this unsafe steroid through their fairness products</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” says</span><b> Dr. Jisha,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a dermatologist who has been campaigning against steroid abuse. She adds “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients are unaware of the risks posed by these fairness products and continue to use them for long periods before seeking help from dermatologists</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The report says, many people buy steroid-based creams, ointment to treat their various skin problems like acne, pigmentation, fungal infection, rash, etc directly from the </span><b>chemists who are allowed to sell the drug freely without a dermatologist's prescription.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unfortunately, this magic drug causes more damage to the skin than it repairs if you don’t use it right. You may even develop various skin diseases on the application of such steroids. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how bad “steroid” in your fairness cream affects you:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steroid causes </span><b>skin thinning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to which </span><b>wrinkles</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appear on skin sooner than they should.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It causes </span><b>stretch marks,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially in the armpit region which is permanent and irreversible.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excessive use of steroids</span><b> tears up the skin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and causes</span><b> hypersensitivity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It increases the </span><b>thickness </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>length of your hair on the skin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are high chances that this steroid </span><b>affects your eyesight</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the surrounding tissue absorbs it.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It even reduces the skin’s ability to </span><b>fight off bacterial and fungal infections. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your skin is left with weaker immunity.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, when you stop using your fairness cream, it results in </span><b>intense facial redness and the formation of fluid-filled bumps damaging the skin.</b><b>
</b><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the ill-effects are just endless!</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our fairness craze has given opportunities for cosmetic companies to misuse steroids &amp; promote it as “fairness creams” which is further marketed by </span><b>profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies. </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s be aware of steroid abuse and try to choose wiser! Say NO to fairness creams.</span>
