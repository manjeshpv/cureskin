<span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s society, where having a glowing skin translates often to a glowing review of the personality and a better public image, the pressure to maintain and improve skin condition is high.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest dangers of having dull skin is how unappealing it can look, apart from any health-related red flags that it may indicate. When left unattended, dull skin can slowly lead to a diminished self-confidence and general dismay in individuals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is often one of the main reasons why </span><strong><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-seeing-a-dermatologist/"><i>people reach out to dermatologists</i></a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the first place, to address this issue. Since it is not an obvious skin condition like acne, the solution to it doesn’t come to people as fast as concocted home remedies that they find for pimples.</span>

<h2><em>Dangers of having Dull skin</em></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But when it comes to the dangers of having dull skin, it is against the advice of experts to ignore dull skin because it is often a cry from your body trying to ask for help.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, if you are a smoker or a constant consumer of alcohol, chances are high that you may have more dull and drab looking skin. This is because such products drain your skin off one important substance that it needs for looking healthy, and that is oxygen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, when the skin is dehydrated it tends to show in certain characteristic ways. One main sign is when there are itchy patches on the dull skin. This is combined with dark under-eye circles.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And if the skin is additionally flaky in certain regions, peeling to reveal more sensitive skin, then the condition is severe. These are the basic signs which alert you of dehydration, which uses dull skin as an indicator.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dull skin is an affliction we face when there is a lack of adequate blood circulation. Everyone today aspires to have glowing and healthy looking skin, and one of the easiest ways to obtain this is to adopt vitamin C into your lives.</span>

<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcureskinapp%2Fposts%2F2230786287246345%3A0&amp;width=500" width="500" height="702" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it has always been well known for being a vital component in healthy living, its effects on the skin are now being studied and prove to be astonishing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin C has the capability of suppressing an enzyme known as tyrosinase. This enzyme is what usually prompts and triggers the production of melanin in cells called melanocytes. This is especially effective on pigments that are present around hair follicles. Luckily these are prevalent throughout our body.</span>
<h2><em>What could be the solution?</em></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this pursuit of good skin, people are slowly realizing when they have comparatively duller skin and look for solutions. And since the cause for dull skin lies in unhealthy habits, the solution is to follow and adopt a set of healthy habits.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This starts with hydration. Since oxygen and nutrients are the two main contributors to glowing skin, lack of moisture and hydration in the body can deprive the body of both. The natural nutrient content of water and its basic hydration of the body will always help in improving the dullness of skin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This should be followed up with a healthy diet plan. Withholding nutrients from our system and indulging in unnecessary junk food does no good for the body and results in dull skin. So go ahead and pack nutrients and greens into your diet with plenty of fluids for glowing skin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as you may like to live life to the fullest and indulge in alcohol consumption, it will slowly but surely show up on your skin. This and smoking robs the body of nutrients and produces free radicals that damage the skin structure.</span>
