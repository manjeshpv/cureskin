<em><strong>Don’t see the same glow as before on your face? Tried every home remedy and over the counter product there is for Dull skin? Wondering if it is serious?</strong></em>
<h2><em>Why does your skin look dull?</em></h2>
Dull skin is one of the <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/skin-conditions-by-skin-type-a-guide/"><em><strong>most common skin conditions</strong></em></a> and it is not as complicated as it may seem. You see the radiance that is associated with young and healthy skin in your 20’s since your skin cells turn over every 28 days. As you age, the turn over process of the skin cells becomes slower hence making your skin look dull.

Also, given the hectic schedules taking time to <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/face-wash-and-its-frequency-of-use-what-that-means-to-your-skin/"><em><strong>regularly wash your face</strong></em></a>, apply a face mask on both face and neck, properly exfoliate the skin to remove dead cells and improve blood flow are not a part of our skin care routine. This takes a toll on the health of the skin making it look dull and sometimes even leading to appearance of dark spots.

Sometimes even our lifestyle habits like not<a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/5-benefits-of-drinking-water-for-the-skin/"><em><strong> drinking enough water</strong></em></a>, not getting enough hours of sleep, not maintaining a balanced diet and not removing makeup before going to bed, etc. that worsen the case. Add to that dust and pollutants in the air that make skin tone uneven and any kind of treatment ineffective.

Call it the side-effects of technology or something else, but &nbsp;people tend to take dull skin treatment lightly and try every remedy out there first before <em><strong><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-seeing-a-dermatologist/">consulting a dermatologist</a></strong></em>. Home based remedies that you read on the internet may seem promising but they are not backed by scientific methods.

Over the counter products that you trust have a very generic composition and sometimes even harmful ingredients, hence they may not be able to solve your issue of dull skin.

Lastly, <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/5-reasons-why-a-general-physician-cant-solve-your-skin-problems/"><em><strong>consulting a general physician</strong></em></a> for your dull skin treatment is of no use because what a dermatologist is qualified to do is what will help your skin get better.

Now that you know the root cause of this issue lies deep beneath the surface of your skin, do you still think over the counter products or generic creams can help get rid of dull skin? This is where <em><strong>CureSkin</strong></em> steps in as your online dermatologist.
