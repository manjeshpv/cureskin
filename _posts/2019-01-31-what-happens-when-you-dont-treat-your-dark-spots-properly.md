<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since we can remember, there have been people of all colors living around us in different parts of the world. From the glistening melanin-rich skin of the native Africans, the pale Caucasian skin seen in Europe and America, to the dusky gleam of skin we come across in India, the variations in skin colour are limitless.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is all determined by an important part of our skin’s structure, which produces the pigment that gives us color. </span><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/skin-pigmentation-what-is-it-causes-and-treatment/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pigmentation</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the term coined for this process, and it decides what color appears on what part of our skin. However, there are certain factors, both genetic and environmental which can influence it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark spots are flat brown spots on your skin that may vary in size. It’s hard to notice when you get your first dark spot, but when they begin to grow in number, it has an evident effect on your appearance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark spots may not be harmful to your health, being just another defense mechanism your skin uses. There are areas under our skin called Melanocytes. When these sites are activated (Melanocyte activity), they produce excessive amounts of melanin to defend the skin against harmful UV rays.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But they do hamper the look of a person and ruins ones's confidence.  When the face is covered with prominent dark marks one doesn't really feel nice about their skin.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<h2><em>What Causes Dark Spots?</em></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the leading causes for dark spots showing up on your skin include sun exposure, pregnancy and <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/sunburn-skin-how-to-treat-sun-damaged-skin/"><em><strong>skin inflammation</strong></em></a>. At times, hyperpigmentation as a condition can trigger the appearance of dark spots on the skin, especially if the skin is injured at some point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Dark spots is more common in people with dark skin who have more melanin production, it can happen to anyone.  The exact triggers of Dark spots could be anything from lifestyle to genetics as well. Sometimes even hormonal changes can stimulate melanin production tat leads to dark spots. Certain foods may also trigger hyperpigmentation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the causes of Dark spots are uncertain, it is important that a dermatologist diagnoses your condition and gives you the right treatment for your skin type.</span>

<h2><b>What happens when you leave Dark spots unattended?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So when you leave dark spots unattended, it means you may be ignoring the signs of sun damage, and even significant hormonal changes that you need to have addressed by doctors. Also,  over the counter products which are usually topical treatments tend to affect sensitive skin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, leaving dark spots without the right care will only lead to the spreading of the condition and worsening of the spots. It is extremely rare for dark spots on your face to vanish of their own accord. This is one of the primary reasons why experts suggest a visit to the local dermatologist on a regular basis for lightening dark spots.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to skin issues like Dark spots, timely and accurate treatment can go a long way. Ignoring your issue for too long might make it even more severe leaving laser treatment as your only option. Trying home based remedies like lemon juice and aloe vera that are not back by scientific research might work for some and not for others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Irregular skin pigmentation causes dark spots and most topical creams do not penetrate the skin deep enough to lighten the pigmentation. This is why your conventional anti-aging cream, sunscreens or other generic skin care products do no good in reducing Dark spots. <em><strong>CureSkin</strong></em> treatments in contrast target the specific skin issue and hence show better results.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like how we know a fruit is spoiled by taking a look at its outer skin, we can make out issues in our body by the way our skin appears Being the largest organ in the body it is a way of alerting us when all is not well in the system. But a visit and consultation with a dermatologist to get rid of dark spots is easier said than done.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially for people living in more suburban cities or leading busy lifestyles which cannot always accommodate the long waiting hours at a skin care clinic. This is where an application like </span><strong><i>CureSkin</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can change the whole experience of skin care.
