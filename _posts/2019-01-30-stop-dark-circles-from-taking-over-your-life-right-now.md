<em><strong>Waking up to dark, puffy eyes is an absolute nightmare that most people fear. Not only do dark circles make you look perpetually dull but also older than your age. The <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/under-eye-dark-circles-why-they-dont-go-away-easily/">worst part about dark circles is that they keep coming back</a>. After a point, even a full night of shut-eye, home remedies, expensive creams or serums don’t seem to help. How to stop dark circles from taking over then?</strong></em>
<h2><em><b>Are surgical procedures the only way to reduce Dark circles? </b></em></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is when most people tend to choose one of the two extremes. They either opt for expensive surgical procedures and treatments or accept dark circles under the eyes as something that cannot be treated. But what if we told you that dark circles don’t have to be a permanent part of your life?</span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you read that right! You don’t have to make your peace with dark circles.</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think you have tried every remedy there is to get rid of under eye bags and they have failed hence medical treatments are your last resort, it’s time to reconsider your approach using <strong><em>CureSkin</em></strong>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many cosmetic procedures like laser surgery, chemical peels, tissue fillers, etc that claim to treat dark circles. Two major reasons to avoid this approach to stop dark circles are cost and side-effects.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><i>Also read: </i><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/6-reasons-why-you-might-be-getting-under-eye-dark-circles/"><i>6 reasons why you might be getting under eye Dark Circles</i></a></strong></p>

<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost </span></i></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of such treatments depends on the severity of your condition but still is too high. A generic under-eye gel or eye cream for Dark circles would cost anywhere between Rs. 1000 to Rs. 3000. At </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CureSkin, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the treatment regimen is priced reasonably and assures best results.</span>
<h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side-effects</span></i></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The skin around your eyes is sensitive and post-operative pain could cause a lot of discomforts. Other common side effects could be itching, redness and swelling after the surgery. Certain skin types after such treatments may become more prone to hyperpigmentation.</span>
