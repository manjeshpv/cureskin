<em><strong>There is approximately 810000 number of hair loss sufferers worldwide. So it’s not a surprise as to why there are more and more hair loss treatments and why its one of the most booming industries too. And you know it well because you’ve been in that club for quite some time now.</strong></em>

There are different types of hair fall control treatments available for both men and woman to keep hair healthy and you must have tried a few of them that too at a very high price to pay for.
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcureskinapp%2Fposts%2F2259551871036453%3A0&amp;width=500" width="500" height="676" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>

<h2><em>Are the hair fall control products really worth it?</em></h2>
Remedies for Hair fall control are generic in nature and are the same for all. But the fact is that the same treatment doesn’t work for everybody the way it should makes it clear that every individual needs customized treatments and regimen suited to stop hair fall  in their case.

The moment one notices signs of hair fall some of the most commonly sorted ways to curb the issue are trying out natural home remedies, buying over the counter products meant generally for hair fall or even <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/5-reasons-why-a-general-physician-cant-solve-your-skin-problems/"><em><strong>consulting a general physician</strong></em></a> who might not be qualified to solve your problem.

<em><strong>You have seen one or more of these remedies work wonders for people around you. This is the reason you decided to give them a try. But why aren't any of these working for you then?  What could be the reason?</strong></em>
<h3><em>Are home remedies effective?</em></h3>
Also, most of the treatments including home remedies or generic over the counter products that claim to prevent hair loss are not scientifically backed. Specific instructions on their methods of usage, quantity etc are not clear hence their effectiveness is questionable.

Techniques like using Onion juice, <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/aloe-vera-benefits-and-uses/"><em><strong>Aloe Vera</strong></em></a> or even green tea that are touted to be some of the best remedies may work for some and show no difference at all for others. The results depend on the type of hair and scalp condition as well.  This is why you see certain remedies working amazingly well for some but not doing any good to your hair.

<h3><em>Is self-medication worsening your condition?</em></h3>
Self-medication is another way people resort to for reducing hair fall. This practice should stop because we do not know what our hair type and scalp condition is.  Going wrong with something as simple as your method of application of a certain product meant for hair fall control can lead to something as serious as rupturing your hair follicles.

Any kind of unsupervised medications may lead to loss of more hair strands than before hence worsening your condition. Commercial hair fall treatments are harmful and some of them have bad side effects on the skin as well.
<h3><em>What about the products on commercials?</em></h3>
Most of the mainstream hair fall treatments are expensive and positive results are not one-hundred percent guaranteed. The products may contain harsh ingredients and may have side effects too. The generic composition of most of these products are not meant to cater to the needs of specific hair type and skin condition.  To control hair fall the treatment needs to be from inside out with proper care.
<h3><em>What should you do now?</em></h3>
To promote <em><strong><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/hair-fall-and-hair-growth-the-complete-guide/">hair growth</a></strong></em>, apart from maintaining a healthy diet rich in protein and iron, changes in lifestyle habits like using a mild shampoo to wash your hair and being careful to avoid brushing wet hair, it is always advisable to have a professional look at your issue and get the right treatment plan.
