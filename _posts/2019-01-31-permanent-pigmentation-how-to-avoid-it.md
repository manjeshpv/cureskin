<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideal skin expectations are rarely met in real life like we would want them to. The airbrushed covers of magazines display women with perfectly even toned and smooth skin, devoid of any of the blemishes that we find disrupting our skin in our everyday life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most persistent skin conditions that pester people is uneven skin tone caused by pigmentation. What do you do about the infuriating patches of skin on your faces that are darker or lighter?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is all determined by an important part of our skin's structure, which produces the pigment that gives us color. </span><em><b>Pigmentation</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the term coined for this process, and it decides what color appears on what part of our skin.</span><b style="font-size: 0.8125rem;"> </b>

<em><b>Pigmentation</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is essentially the coloring of our skin, hair, and retina that is caused by the production of a pigment. This particular pigment goes by the name of </span><em><b>melanin</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and cells known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">melanocytes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically produce it</span><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/beauty-hair/a19890/what-is-pigmentation-and-how-to-treat-it/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A healthy skin would be reflected in an even distribution of pigment throughout the face and body. On the other hand, any defects to the cells or in melanin production may lead to targeted patches of irregularity or overall disruption in skin tone. This is often when pigmentation becomes a skin condition to be treated. Indians especially are subjected to this more</span><a href="https://www.indiatimes.com/health/healthyliving/pigmentation-causes-and-home-remedies-242856.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The three major types of skin disorders that are caused by such pigmentation irregularities are </span><em><b>hypopigmentation</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><em><b>hyperpigmentation</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><em><b>depigmentation</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although we may feel like pigmentation issues can be easily addressed, this may not always be the case.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidance and advice of dermatologists and skin care specialists are often the best option to take, especially when battling skin conditions like pigmentation. This is because if left unchecked this can become a permanent condition.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is easier said than done, especially for people living in more suburban cities. This is where an app like CureSkin can change the whole experience of skin care. <em><strong>CureSkin</strong></em> is an online skin care platform that provides dermatological solutions and cares through a mobile application.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of the application lies in its simplicity, where the user has to merely answer a set of questions and take a photograph of their skin condition for diagnostic purposes. And the result is that the app develops a customized skin care regimen for you that you can then purchase.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, it schedules call appointments with its certified dermatologists who track your skin’s progress with regular photo updates and analyze the skin continually to achieve the best possible result. This consists of follow-up calls every two weeks till the customer is satisfied with their skin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dermatologists often recommend a few basic solutions to pigmentation. The use of sunscreen with a good Sun Protection Factor (SPF) whenever stepping out in the sun is advised, because this can be the biggest enemy for the skin. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exposing skin to the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays (UV-A or UV-B) means allowing the formation of free radicals that can damage cell structure, leading to hyperpigmentation.</span>

<em><strong>The second biggest culprit for pigmentation, specifically on the face, is hormonal imbalance. In this case, a possible presence of excess estrogen can lead to the immune system unwantedly triggering the production of melanin, even though there is no actual need for it. These can never be sensed or diagnosed without the help of dermatologists. This is all the more reason why an application like CureSkin can be of better help in combating permanent pigmentation.</strong></em>
