<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have touched your face and have not liked how your skin feels, then it is time to seriously analyze your skin condition.  Acne is much like one of those unwanted house guests who come knocking at your doorstep, regardless of whether they are welcome or not. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a natural and inevitable part of your </span><strong><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/skin-conditions-by-skin-type-a-guide/"><i>skin’s lifetime condition</i></a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>,</strong> but it is just as easy to treat and manage if you have the right tools in your arsenal.</span>

<em><strong>This would include the right guidance from skincare specialists, and the right products and skincare routine. But what of the cases which are ignored?</strong></em>
<h2><em>What could ignoring acne do for your skin? </em></h2>
<strong><i>“Not much of good”</i> is probably the most apt answer.</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem absurd to some people to think that there may be people with acne out there who choose to ignore and fail to address it, but they sure are out there. Or you may even be one of them. According to dermatologists, </span><strong><i><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/5-reasons-why-you-need-to-take-your-acne-seriously/">ignoring acne</a> </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">treatments can be the worst action to make when considering the well being and appearance of your skin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><strong><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/what-causes-pimples/"><i>pimple is a skin abnormality</i></a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that occurs when glands known as the sebaceous glands</span><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/71702.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get clogged, which leads to an infection and swelling. These glands when functioning normally, secrete oils which attribute to oily skin and scalp. When pimples become a recurring thing, this classifies as acne.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They could be anything from a benign blackhead to a serious cyst formation, hence never should we simply turn a blind eye towards the changes in our skin. That, if followed as a primary rule for skincare, would ensure a much healthier future for your skin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To always be aware of the condition of your skin means spotting inconsistencies and possible damage at an early stage. After all, prevention is known to be better than cure. The worst thing to do would be to ignore the issue entirely and hope for the best because it most definitely will not be helpful.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While </span><strong><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/comedones-what-are-they/"><i>comedones may be harmless to a certain extent</i></a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>,</strong> there are other more severe forms that can leave your skin permanently scarred, such as cystic acne. If your skin condition has advanced to this stage of inflammatory acne, it becomes much tougher to heal, even with treatment.</span>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the advanced </span><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/what-are-the-different-types-of-acne-a-list/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>forms of acne</strong></span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where it is a constant source of pain and is a hardened red lump that is swollen in appearance</span><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/103258.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The difference between cystic acne and nodules is that nodules contain pus while cysts don’t. Teenage hormonal changes play a role in causing these.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, a matter of comfort is those general statistics based on acne show that the occurrence of cysts is far lesser than normal acne. Acne is completely treatable but in case it does appear, it is </span><strong><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-seeing-a-dermatologist/"><i>mandatory that you visit a dermatologist</i></a></strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">immediately to address it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <em><strong>CureSkin</strong></em> app detects and diagnoses your Skin and Hair issues and provides the right treatment to resolve them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring signs of developing acne can not only lead to more permanent damage but also longer healing time and even pain. The best way to deal with acne is by continuous care and attention, along with a proper skincare routine which is suited for your skin</span>
