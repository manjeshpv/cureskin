<h1><em>Do you need expensive Acne treatment to clear your face again?</em></h1>
<strong>Have red spots, painful pimples and whiteheads taken over your face? Wondering how long will it take for your Acne to clear your face?</strong>

Acne is not only one of the most <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/skin-conditions-by-skin-type-a-guide/"><em><strong>common skin conditions</strong></em></a> but also one of the most dreaded ones because it can have lasting consequences on your skin and your self-confidence. Even then, most people still opt for home based treatments on noticing first signs of a breakout.

<span style="font-size: 0.8125rem;">When your sebaceous glands produce excess oil and clog the pores on your skin, it leads to deposition and skin issues. Not attending to the issue right away will make even mild acne severe and may lead to permanent acne scarring. What should you do then?</span>

Some try Over the Counter (OTC) products while others consult their general physician for help. Topical antibiotics, prescription medication, oral medication or oral antibiotics may work for some but not for everyone.

Home remedies are not backed by scientific validation and hence experimenting with acne using such methods can lead to further skin damage.

It is important to understand that unless your treatments are based on accurate analysis of the type of acne it is difficult to treat acne completely.

<h2><em>Are expensive treatments the answer then?</em></h2>
If you have tried all of the above remedies (and more) but don’t see any effect on your Acne and are considering expensive treatments like chemical peeling then give it a second thought. Generally it would cost you about Rs.2000 for each of your Acne treatment sessions.

The sessions go on till the Acne remains hence amounting to a heavy bill for the pocket. Acne is a serious issue and without the right kind of treatment and skin care it can become almost impossible for you to get rid of it.  Also, Leaving your Acne scars unattended may lead to acne scars, skin irritation and other side-effects.
