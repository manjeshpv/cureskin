<em><strong>Is your discolored skin taking over your natural glow? Worried if Pigmentation is permanent? Do you really need cosmetic treatments? Not sure what you should try next?</strong></em>
<h2><em>CureSkin has the answers to all your questions!</em></h2>
The exact<strong><em> <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/skin-pigmentation-what-is-it-causes-and-treatment/">causes of Skin Pigmentation</a> </em></strong>are unknown but it is mainly linked to hormonal changes, heredity, certain medication, <strong><em><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/sunburn-skin-how-to-treat-sun-damaged-skin/">sun exposure</a> </em></strong>etc. It is characterized by appearance of age spots and a change in skin colour in different parts of the body.

The quantity of Melanin (cells produced by Melanocyte cells) can be altered by certain lifestyle habits like smoking, environmental factors like dust and pollution or could be genetic in nature.

Hence the process of determining why some individuals face Pigmentation issues more than others is a complicated task. This is the reason why treatments for pigmentation work on some people and don’t show the same effect on others.
<h2><em>Why most hyperpigmentation treatments don't work</em></h2>
Now imagine trying to treat  hyperpigmentation which is a sensitive condition, on your own. Unlike the carefully curated treatments provided to you on CureSkin, remedies on the internet are put out there without any clinical trials and they do not cater to the needs of your skin in specific.

These methods and remedies do not cater to treatments required for specific type of pigmentation so when you blindly try them, you are basically doing more harm than good.

Treatments and therapies like Chemical peeling, Dermabrasion, Laser  treatment not only burn a hole in your pocket but could also cause temporary or permanent side-effects like change in skin color, scarring, etc. Also, the patient's medical history need to be taken into account before  any cosmetic procedure to avoid risks of severe side-effects of chemical peels and laser.
<h2><em>You don't need cosmetic pigmentation treatment!</em></h2>
