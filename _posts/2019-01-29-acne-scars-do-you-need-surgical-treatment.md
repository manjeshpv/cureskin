<em><strong>Still struggling with stubborn Acne scars? Did you know these marks could be permanent? Should surgical treatment be your next move then?</strong></em>

<em><strong><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/what-happens-when-you-dont-get-your-acne-scars-treated/">Acne scars</a></strong></em> are intractable and become worse when the treatment is not right. There is no magic potion for making Acne scars disappear overnight and without the right kind of skin care it may become permanent. One of the most common type of acne scars is the rolling scar that becomes very prominent on the skin.

If Acne leaves behind indentations or raised spots, it means the damage has occurred at a deeper level in the skin cells. This calls for expert attention and not remedies that you read on the internet. Skin resurfacing is one of the most sought after treatments for Acne scars and removing dead skin.

<em>If the word “expert attention” makes you think of surgical treatments then here are some things you should know.</em>
<h2><em>Cost</em></h2>
On an average, the cost of Acne scar treatments range from 1500-2000 rupees per session and additional amount for the recommended products. Such treatments are generic in nature and do not prove to be effective.
<h2><em>Instructions</em></h2>
These treatments do not come with proper instructions and hence do not show the results you expect.  When you have acne prone skin using products without getting proper instructions from an expert may cause more harm than good. Not knowing how much quantity of the product to use and when leads to side-effects.

<h2><em>Results</em></h2>
Even after spending a lot of money these generic treatments and products do not guarantee positive results. Some treatments include only topical treatments that work only at the top layer of the skin. Certain treatments such as Chemical peeling entail serious side-effects such as redness on the skin,<em><strong> <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/what-are-dark-spots-and-what-causes-them/">dark spots</a> </strong></em>etc.
