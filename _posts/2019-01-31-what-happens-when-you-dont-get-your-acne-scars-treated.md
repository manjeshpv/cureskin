<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to survive everyday life without getting a scratch on us is far tougher than it sounds. It may be from something as small as a skirmish with your feisty sibling. It could also be a persistent pimple or acne that shows up on the same spot despite your tirades of abuse against it, but they all leave a parting gift in the form of a scar.</span>

<h2><em>What is a Scar?</em></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A scar is the human body’s version of a hasty cover-up, and the American Academy of Dermatology defines a scar as a residual mark from the healing of a wound</span><a href="https://www.aad.org/public/kids/skin/scars"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The skin’s outermost layer is known as the epidermis while the layer underneath it is the dermis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever a wound is inflicted, damaging the dermis, it immediately gets to work on creating a cover over the wound to protect it from bacteria and germs. This cover is in the form of a structural protein called collagen that is produced by fibroblasts sent from the dermis</span><a href="https://www.newgelplus.com/blog/2017/08/30/role-collagen-scar-formation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The collagen can be called the skin’s best friend, the big protector in their playground who protects the vulnerable skin from the bullies, so to speak. Unfortunately, it is often our worst nightmare, because it’s the reason why scars are evident on our skin. In its haste to cover up, the collagen isn’t always allowed to settle in a neat lattice pattern as that of normal skin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This forms the characteristic lumps and indents that stand out on your skin, either when you’re retelling your heroic stories of how you got it or trying to hide your clumsiness.</span>
<h2><em>How bad are Acne scars?</em></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Acne is a skin abnormality which occurs when glands known as the sebaceous glands</span><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/71702.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(3)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get clogged, which leads to an infection and swelling. These glands when functioning normally secrete oils which attribute to oily skin and scalp. Wounds </span><strong><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/what-causes-acne/"><i>caused by pimples</i></a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and acne and other skin conditions cause the scars on the face. This is what usually happens when you avoid getting your acne scar treatment.</span>

<h2><em>Types of Acne scars</em></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two main categories of Acne scars namely Atropic scars (scars caused by a loss of tissues) and Hypertrophic scars (scars caused by an excess of tissues). Treatment for each of these types is different and specific to the condition of your skin. Over-the counter medications aren't effective enough and may in some cases cause red marks or other such reactions. Only a dermatologist can analyse which type of scar you are suffering from and which treatment will suit your skin type.</span>
<h2><em><b>How to get rid of Acne scars?</b></em></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having healthy and normal looking skin tone is actually quite possible if the acne is treated with medicine and the right skin care routine for your skin type from the beginning.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get rid of Acne scars , you will have to make sure you treat your acne properly. Acne prone skin needs to be given extra attention and care to ensure the breakout doesn't leave scars.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To always be aware of the </span><strong><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/skin-conditions-by-skin-type-a-guide/"><i>condition of your skin</i></a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means spotting inconsistencies and possible damage at an early stage. After all, prevention is known to be better than cure. This means early detection is an important step in Acne treatment.</span>
