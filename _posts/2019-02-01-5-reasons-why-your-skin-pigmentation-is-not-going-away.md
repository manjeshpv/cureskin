<b><i>Internet has been our go-to-option for anything and everything these days. We are so used to it that we find our alternative doctors and professional advice online. Typing in symptoms and finding the solution is easier than actually visiting a doctor right?</i></b>

<b><i>Wrong!</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The skin is the largest and arguably the most sensitive organ in our body. Experimenting with remedies off the internet when you face an issue as serious as Skin pigmentation is like putting the largest organ of your body at the risk of an allergic reaction or something even worse.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If all your home remedies, over the counter products and generic medications haven't done any good in solving your issue of skin pigmentation, it is time to reconsider your approach. Your wrong approach towards treating your condition could be the prime reason why you still suffer from Skin pigmentation.</span>

<h2><em>Here are some of the other reasons why your skin pigmentation is not going away:</em></h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3><i>You may be treating it wrong</i></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One should never take such risks about their health and medical conditions. We may find good alternatives and preventive tips online but it’s not the right treatment for your issue. You may find names of medicines and creams for skin pigmentation and you decide to try it but do you know that it does more harm than good for you.</span>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3><i>You are not aware of the depth of the condition</i></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You switch medicines and give it another try but fail again. Then you just let it go and wait for a miracle. You clearly have no idea how serious skin pigmentation is. Lack of knowledge leads you to make stupid decisions.</span>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3><i>You may have taken medicines but it was not the right one</i></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have tried OTC creams with Hydroquinone in it which is usually prescribed for for skin pigmentation. But it must not have been the right dosage for your condition. Only a Dermatologist can determine these critical details for you.</span>
<ol start="4">
 	<li>
<h3><i>You aren’t wearing the right sunscreen</i></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/how-to-use-sunscreen-directions-and-tips/"><em><strong>Using sunscreen regularly</strong></em></a> is very important. At the same time getting the right sunscreen is also important. Dermatologists recommend one with SPF 30 and more to prevent skin pigmentation.</span>

<h3><i> Your skin care regimen might be to blame</i></h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Toner, cleanser, <a href="https://cureskin.com/articles/face-wash-and-its-frequency-of-use-what-that-means-to-your-skin/"><em>face wash</em></a>, scrub, night creams, moisturizers and other products you use as your daily skin care regimen might not be the one suited for you. The products need to be suitable for your skin type and should address your issue of skin pigmentation accurately.</span>
