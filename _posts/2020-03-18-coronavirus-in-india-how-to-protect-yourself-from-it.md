<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here comes corona, affecting not just hundreds but lakhs because of its ability to spread rapidly! Even though the current situation is serious, with simple personal hygiene measures, it is possible to protect ourselves from it &amp; avoid further spread of this virus.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what you must know to protect yourself and possibly others from coronavirus.</span></i>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How CORONA Virus spreads?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔ When someone infected coughs on your eyes, nose or mouth, this virus enters your body infecting you in and out. Billion virus can float on one tiny droplet in the air from just one cough.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔ Sometimes, a sick person’s saliva gets on other things such as their own hand, doorknob, pens, keyboard, mouse, cups, lift button, stair handles, etc. Touching any of these things, followed by rubbing your eyes, touching nose or mouth can make you sick as well.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why it is good to follow these precautions.</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔</span><b> Do not shake hands even if it’s not polite!</b><b>
</b><b>   </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>Why? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Coronaviruses can easily spread through skin-to-skin touching</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s better to be rude than to be sick. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔</span><b> Avoid crowds, stay at home if you can!</b><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>Why? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    You don’t know who might be sick. The higher the number of people you meet, the higher the risk.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔</span><b> Stay away from your sick friends!</b><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>Why? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Exposing yourself to someone sick increases the chances of infections. Hence, keeping a distance is the best way to show you care right now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔ </span><b>Choose to maintain a safe distance of 0.5m to 2m from others.</b><b>
</b><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>Why? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Sometimes, people who are infected can show no symptoms but are still infectious. Avoid being physically close to others.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔ </span><b>Wear a mask when you go out! </b><b>
</b><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>Why? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Viruses can be everywhere. A mask acts as a barrier against infection-causing viruses. It doesn’t guarantee that you won’t get sick. But, they do cut down the chances of the disease being passed on. Also, don’t wear it for more than a day. Bacteria grow inside your mask too if you wear them too long.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔</span><b> Say NO to outside food!</b>

<b>    Why? </b><b>
</b><b>    </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll never know who cooked your food, how it was cooked, and what it went through before it reaches you. It’s always safer to eat home-cooked food. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>✔ Use tissues to touch your eyes, ears, nose instead of bare hands</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">!
</span><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><b>Why? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    It’s also a major way we pick up infections like coronavirus. Better avoid it in the first place.</span><b>
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">

</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔</span><b> Let hand sanitizer go with you everywhere!</b>

<b>    Why? </b><b>
</b><b>    </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viruses can last up to 48 hours on objects. Wash your hands frequently &amp; thoroughly back and forth with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer for at least 20 secs, you’ll never know what you’ve touched unknowingly.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔</span><b> Intake lots of  Vitamin C! </b>

<b>    Why? </b><b>
</b><b>    </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin C strengthens your immune system to fight off infections.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">✔</span><b> And finally, seek medical advice if you’re showing symptoms!</b>

<b>    Why? </b><b>
</b><b>  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  No matter what we do, bad luck can get us. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, call the doctor for emergency support. Keep yourself safe at home to save others from getting it. </span>

<b><i>Keep yourself and others safe!</i></b>
